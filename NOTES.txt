have the rainbow be more like here https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_framebuffer_texture

ultimatly have it be half bnlack and half white

-- draw a star with open gl not texture, having it change color at faster rate and rotate
    in more interesting way
    --could split star up and hvae different segments animate differently
- have 'cross' at center of cube the matrix pattern emits from
- circle bigger and make the line thickness of the 

4/12
- desync the color and star color change oscillation, have the color of the star olliscate whitish tint color
- have the cube emit a golden aura, maybe shooting star like effects could be small cubes shooting off of it almost radioactivfe looking
- try to apply this color changing algirthmn to the matrix lines somehow figure out how they did it https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_framebuffer_texture
